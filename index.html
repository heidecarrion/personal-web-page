        <p>I have worked as a hardware and software technical support specialist for many years. 
          While majoring in physics during university, I became interested in computer science and learning to code software. All things technological fascinate me. My passion is software engineering with all of its intricacies. 
          As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, my goal is to continue my enriching journey in software engineering.</p>

        <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy watching movies, video-editing, reading, cooking, and hanging out with my family. My favorite hobby is weight training!</p>
